Thank you for your interest in contributing to the EmbedJs project documentation! Please follow the instructions below to get started:

Step 1. Go to the `docs/` directory (where you can find `mint.json`) and run the following command:

```bash
npx mintlify dev
```

The documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port Mintlify runs on. For example, use this command to run in port 3333:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify in a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```
