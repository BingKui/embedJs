title: 'Hugging Face'
---

The library supports generating embeddings using the Hugging Face Inference API.
By default it uses the `sentence-transformers/distilbert-base-nli-mean-tokens` model but you can pass it a model parameter to use any other model available on the Hugging Face model hub.

To use Hugging face embedding models via its Inference API, you need to get a free token.
You can get this API Token by signing up for hugging face and visiting [this page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
Set it to the environment like so -

```bash
HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_KEY="<Your hf key>"
```

## Install Huggingface addon

```bash
npm install @llm-tools/embedjs-huggingface
```

## Usage

```ts
import { RAGApplicationBuilder } from '@llm-tools/embedjs';
import { HuggingFaceEmbeddings } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-huggingface';
import { HNSWDb } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-hnswlib';

const app = await new RAGApplicationBuilder()
.setEmbeddingModel(new HuggingFaceEmbeddings())
```
