To use the OpenAI embedding models, you need a API key from OpenAI.
You can alternatively use Azure OpenAI to run most of the OpenAI embedding models. Read the [Azure OpenAI](/components/llms/azure-openai) section to learn more about this.

To get started, obtain an API Key from OpenAI. You can do this by visiting their [API Portal](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
Once you obtain a key, set it in an environment variable, like so -

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="<Your key>"
```

The EmbedJs OpenAI addon provides the following embedding models -

-   OpenAi3LargeEmbeddings
-   OpenAi3SmallEmbeddings
-   AdaEmbeddings

## Install OpenAI addon

```bash
npm install @llm-tools/embedjs-openai
```

## Usage

```ts
import { RAGApplicationBuilder } from '@llm-tools/embedjs';
import { OpenAi3LargeEmbeddings } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-openai';
import { HNSWDb } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-hnswlib';

const app = await new RAGApplicationBuilder()
.setEmbeddingModel(new OpenAi3LargeEmbeddings())
```
