In order to be able to use an OpenAI model on Azure, it first needs to be deployed.
Please refer to [Azure OpenAI documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/openai/) on how to deploy a model on Azure.
To run this library, you will need to deploy both an LLM and an embedding model. For example -

-   text-embedding-ada (or any of the newer models)
-   GPT-3.5-turbo (or the 4 series)

Once these models are deployed, using Azure OpenAI instead of the regular OpenAI is easy to do. Just follow these steps -

-   Remove the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable if you have set it already.

-   Set the following environment variables -

```bash
# Set this to `azure`
OPENAI_API_TYPE=azure
# The API version you want to use
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-05-15
# The base URL for your Azure OpenAI resource.  You can find this in the Azure portal under your Azure OpenAI resource.
export AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_PATH=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments
# The API key1 or key2 for your Azure OpenAI resource
export AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your Azure OpenAI API key>
# The deployment name you used for your embedding model
AZURE_OPENAI_API_EMBEDDINGS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=text-embedding-ada-002
# The deployment name you used for your llm
AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-35-turbo
```

The OpenAi addon can now be used as is and will automatically use the Azure OpenAI endpoint.

## Install OpenAI addon

```bash
npm install @llm-tools/embedjs-openai
```

## Usage

```ts
import { RAGApplicationBuilder } from '@llm-tools/embedjs';
import { OpenAi } from '@llm-tools/embedjs-openai';

const app = await new RAGApplicationBuilder()
.setModel(new OpenAi({ modelName: "gpt-4o" }))
```
